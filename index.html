          <h2>Why is Personal Finance Essensial?</h2>
          <p>The purpose of financial planning can never be exhaustively explained.
            The reasons are numerous, but we will look at the main ones.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>Ensures That You Meet Your Money Needs</h3>
              <p>What we must understand is that money issues go beyond what most of us think about.
                We should think of our finances in a much broader perspective.
                This way, we will think beyond just going to work and making money.</p>
              <p><em>What comes after making that money?</em> Do we spend? Well, this shouldn’t be the case.</p>
              <p>Some of the topics that you should understand in personal finance include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>How to create and stick to a budget</li>
                <li>Saving for your retirement</li>
                <li>Time value of money</li>
                <li>Credit cards and credit scores</li>
                <li>Inflation, and more.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Offering Family Security</h3>
              <p>Financial security for you and your family is something that most people long for.
                Everyone wants to know that they can cater to the money needs of their family, whether the economy is failing or not.</p>
              <p>No one wants to think of their families suffering due to a lack of money, especially when they are not around to help.
                And for this reason, everyone is struggling to make sure that they earn enough money that can offer them a sense of security.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Offers Better Financial Understanding</h3>
              <p>Yet another importance of personal finance in life is providing a better understanding of your finances.
                It is possible to achieve a better understanding of your finances, when you put in place measurable goals, understand the effects of your decisions, as well as review the results of such.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Growing Your Assets</h3>
              <p>Owning assets as a form of the financial cushion is always a desire for many people.
                However, many assets will come attached with some liabilities.</p>
              <p>This makes it very important to have adequate knowledge of your finances.
                One must be able to determine the real value of a specific asset.</p>
              <p>Knowing how to cancel or settle liabilities only comes through understanding your finances, and this only possible through personal finance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Raising Your Standarts of Living</h3>
              <p>Another importance of financial planning is helping you to increase your living standards.
                But how does personal finance help you to do this?</p>
              <p>Well, the more you plan for your finances, the more your savings will be.
                This means that instead of more money going to unplanned expenses, more will be saved.</p>
              <p>Higher savings can help to cushion you during financially challenging times.</p>
