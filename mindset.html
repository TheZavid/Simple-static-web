      <h2>PERSONAL FINANCE IS REALLY ABOUT VALUES, HABITS AND MINDSET</h2>
      <p>Why bother writing about what credit cards hold the most value when
        you do not even know what your values are?</p>
      <p>Why bother writing about what investing strategy to have when you
        do not even know how much you need to retire or cannot save enough to invest?</p>
      <p>Why bother writing about financial independence when we earn
        different incomes, live in different cities and have markedly different lifestyles?</p>
      <p>Don’t get me wrong — financial literacy is crucial.
        But financial products and strategy are secondary to understanding
        your own values, habits and mindset.</p>
      <p>If eliminating debt or saving for retirement is the destination, consider your VHM the map</p>
      <section>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <p>There is no right answer when it comes to the following topics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rent vs. Own</li>
          <li>Robo-advisors vs. Self-directed investing</li>
          <li>Paying Professionals vs. DIY</li>
          <li>Bank 1 vs. Bank 2</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of these questions are just fluff. The “correct” answer will be
          based on your definition of value-based spending.</p>
        <p>Concentrate on your values and direct your spending to align with them.</p>
      </section>

        <h3>Habits</h3>
        <p>It is important to have big, hairy audacious financial goals, such
          as saving enough money for a new car, a down payment, or simply retirement.
          But the road is a long one — and you will not get there on sheer motivation.</p>
        <p>What you do every day matters.</p>
        <p>Spend less time intimidated by your destination, and concentrate on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Daily tracking of your spending</li>
          <li>Bringing lunch to work</li>
          <li>Weekly financial check-ins with yourself</li>
          <li>Monthly financial conversations with your partner</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Anticipate resistance by implementing regular habits.</em></p>
      </section>

        <h3>Mindset</h3>
        <p><q>Whether you think you can, or you think you
          can’t, you’re right.</q> — Henry Ford</p>
        <p>Do you have Gary Vaynerchuk’s zest and enthusiasm for life?</p>
        <p>Or do you have Friedrich Nietzsche’s nihilism where you believe everything is meaningless?</p>
        <p>I am sure you fall somewhere in the middle.</p>
        <p>The one difference between someone who considers themselves
          successful over someone who considers themselves unsuccessful boils
          down to this: <em>perspective</em>.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Perspective is everything.</h3>
        <p>If you are too hard on yourself, you will give up and doubt your abilities.</p>
        <p>If you are too easy on yourself, you will never push yourself to your greatest capacity.</p>
        <p><em>Aim high. Plan for setbacks. Pivot accordingly.</em></p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Here's Your Homework:</h3>
        <p>After you finish reading this post, open a blank Word document and
          write a list that contains the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your 5 core values(rank them in priority)</li>
          <li>Your 5 new daily habits(i.e. waking up at 5:30 AM, reading while
            eating breakfast, bringing your lunch to work and etc.)</li>
          <li>Your life philosophy (i.e. a mix of frugality? minimalism? a
            belief that you can do anything you want if you work hard enough? Get creative.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Identify your VHM and the rest will follow.</p>
